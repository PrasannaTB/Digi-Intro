            <p>My culture and language i.e. Tamang language is said to have originally come from Tibet. And as Tibetan and Chinese 
                language come from a common ancestral tongue, I want to learn Chinese. Also, because Chinese language is one of the most 
                spoken languages in the world and it's always good to learn as many languages as you can. </p>
            <p>As my university, Haaga-Helia University of Applied Science offers Chinese language courses, I have planned to take some 
              of it, so that I get to learn at least the basics. Then, I can continue learning afterwards by myself if I like and enjoy 
              it.</p><br>

            <h2>About Chinese Language</h2>
            <p>The Chinese language is the oldest written language in the world with around six thousand years of history. Proving that
                 the written Chinese language existed for more than three thousand years, Chinese character inscriptions have been found 
                 in turtle shells dating back to Shang dynasty. The Chinese dictionary contains around 40,000 characters. All around the 
                 world around 1.2 billion people speak different varieties of Chinese.</p>

          <p>The Lantern Festival aka Shangyuan Festival is celebrated on the fifteenth day of the first month of the Lunisolar Chinese 
            calander. This tradition started around 2000 years ago and carries multiple meanings. On the night of the festival, streets 
            are decorated with colorful lanterns with riddles written on them, believed that they bring good fortune. People eat sweet 
            rice balls, watch dragon and lion dances, play games, set off fireworks, etc.</p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™d watched some traditional, historical Chinese dramas where they celebrate this Lantern Festival. The environment looked 
              so festive and joyful, lanterns hanging all around the place, people looking and buying things in the street stalls, playing
               games, dancing, and many more. I liked it and thought I will go to China and be a part of the occasion at least once in my 
               life. I am eagerly looking forward to the day.
