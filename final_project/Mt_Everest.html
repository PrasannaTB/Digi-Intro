            <p>Born on the lap of Himalayas and brought up by rivers and mountains, rhododendrons and yaks, gumbas and forests, 
              I am a mountain girl, and the mountains run in my blood. It is where I belong.  Climbing Mt. Everest which is at the 
              elevation of 8848 meters and getting blessings from Mother Chomolungma has been my dream since I was a child. </p>
            <p>I was born in Solukhumbu district of Nepal, the same district where the highest mountain in the world, Mt. Everest is 
              located. Solukhumbu, the repository of mountains has around 120 named mountains in the district itself. Born and lived 
              there for the first six years of my life, I have seen people, locals or tourists come to climb mountains be it Mt. Everest, 
              Nuptse, Lhotse, Amadablam, Pumori, or any others or go to the base camps. Seeing the Sherpas, the snow leopards climb and 
              guard the himalayas, and make history, I was motivated to have the courage to climb Mt. Everest. </p>
            <p>I have an aunt who went for a solo trek to Mt. Everest, despite all the risks because she wanted to be an example and 
              inspiration for future female solo trekkers. Her trek was a success; furthermore, she made me realize that we should not 
              be afraid to dream. Perception is reality; if you think you can, then you can. This convinced me even further to have the 
              courage to dream big.</p>
            <p>I have planned to take a step closer to fulfilling this wish of mine when I go back to Nepal after graduation. I have 
              thought of going to The Everest Base Camp Trek before I set to climb the whole mountain, so that I get to know how things 
              are going to be out there and how prepared I need to be. I did some research and found out that The Everest Base Camp is at 
              the elevation of 5346 meters above the see level having total length of 101 km. It takes around 14 days to complete the trek. 
              The trek will be moderately difficult and will have average walking hours of 6-7 hours each day.</p>
            <p>I am really excited and looking forward to this adventurous and spiritual long-life experience.</p>
