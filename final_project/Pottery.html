            <h3>My Pottery Experience</h3>
            <p>5 days before I moved to Finland on 15th July 2022, I tried pottery for the very first time in my life. I wanted to try it at 
            least once. As I was moving to Finland I didnâ€™t know if I could get the chance to experience it there; so, I thought why not 
            here. </p>
            <p>There is a place in Bhaktapur, Nepal called The Pottery Square where you can buy different types of clay and ceramics vessels,
             statues; and also try pottery and make your own thing. The whole area carries great historical and cultural importance. 
             Around ten minutes from the pottery square, there is Bhaktapur Durbar Square which is one of the cultural heritages in Nepal 
             and has also been listed in UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
        
             <p>I went there along with my sister and a friend. At first, we went to The Pottery Training Centre. There were many people so, 
            we had to wait for like 40 minutes until finally it was our turn. My sister went first, then me and lastly my friend. I really
             enjoyed the process and also the outcome. I found touching soil/clay with bare hands and making something out of it feels 
             great and wonderful. I made a heart-shaped bowl and a small pot. It was great to have tried pottery and totally worth my time
              and energy. </p>
              <p>After we were all done, we set the vessels to dry and went to The Bhaktapur Durbar Square in the meantime. We 
                roamed around, took pictures, and had the special and famous yogurt of Bhaktapur, Juju Dhau which was super yummy. Following 
                this event, we went back to retrieve our vessels which were dry by then and all set. It was already past 7 pm and was getting 
                pretty dark, so we all returned back home.</p>
                <p>It was a pleasant day, and I had loads of fun and had a great time. It feels really good to try and experience new things. 
                  I would definitely love to do pottery again in the future.</p>
